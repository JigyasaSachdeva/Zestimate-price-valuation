Zillowâ€™s Zestimate home valuation has shaken up the U.S. real estate industry since first released 11 years ago. Zillow uses statistical and machine learning algorithm to predict the true valuation of the property through combining and understanding multiple data points and key features of the house. This project attempts to understand the zestimator's algorithm. The files are as follows:
